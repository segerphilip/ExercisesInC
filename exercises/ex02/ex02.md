# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

- ```stack.c:24:12: warning: address of stack memory associated with local variable 'array'
      returned [-Wreturn-stack-address]
    return array;
           ^~~~~
1 warning generated.```

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

- ```0x7fff5b2254c0
0x7fff5b2254c0
0
1186520662
0
0
0```

- Looks like referencing the array as a local variable inside *foo() and then storing it into a pointer vs accessing the array directly from bar() is wonky. The initial two outputs are of the memory addresses.

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

- ```0
-1508424890
0
0
0```

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!

# Reflection 0
## Context
For Reflection 0, we'd like you to focus on the process of team formation and creating your first sprint backlog. For example, how did you each share your individual goals and combine them to form team goals? How did your team decide on a scrum master and divide other responsibilities? How did you decide what to include and omit from your sprint backlog? What are you still apprehensive about?

## Team formation
The most logical place to start is the actual way we went about forming teams. I have had many different teaming experiences throughout my "career" at Olin, however the biggest takeaway from every experience is that the team matters more than the project. Have a good team? Then the willingness to devote more time to make something cool comes easily. As such, our team formed sort of through similar skill level, as well as the fact that many of the members worked together on previous projects. From there, we talked about our goals, both for the project and the class itself.

## Project planning
The next step in our process was meeting in the early morning and coming with three ideas each, all under the umbrella of the "high performance computing" topic. We then organized these ideas into general subjects that made sense (math, graphics, research) and then ranked each idea with what we liked best. Ultimately, we landed on the idea of creating a 3D representation of a Rubik's cube. Our reasoning was that we could create and optimize the logic as well as create a graphical representation, making the process easy enough to split into reasonable chunks and triage amongst ourselves. This then led well into creating issues and assigning to group members. Much of this sprint is organized in the hopes of front-loading as much C learning, so later sprints can focus more on features.

## Responsibilities and looking ahead
I just offered to work as scrum master. We all had a pretty solid grasp of the Agile process, either from internship experience or other team projects, so it wasn't a contested position. Now, moving forward, the biggest things that we need to accomplish are creating a graphical implementation. Graphics are tricky, because they never feel completely done, so we will need to timebox that work to some capacity. However, our team is excited about the topic and plan on putting in extra effort because why not?!

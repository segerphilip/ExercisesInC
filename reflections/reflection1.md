# Sprint reflection 1
## Philip Seger

This was sort of an interesting first proper sprint for this course. While a lot of the introductory material was just starting to be touched on, our team was jumping head first into the project that we had set our sights on, namely building a graphical representation of a Rubik’s cube and solving said cube. The sprint started with members of the team working on different aspects, sort of generating practice files and doing research. As things continued on, testing files started to take shape and more defined splits between program functions were more clearly notated. This meant that at a point, a graphical representation of the Rubik’s cube was completed. From there, integration started happening fairly quickly, however we ended the sprint mid-integration (which was completed on Monday). 
The largest takeaway that tripped us up this sprint was namely organization. Our kaizen from reflection is that we should each leave every meeting with a clearly-defined task which we can work on before the next class. This should organize us better moving forward, and also help team members know what aspects of the project they are supposed to be covering. Organizing at the start of our meetings already has been useful, having a five minute “standup” (we sit) keeps us updated with what members have completed or are working on and what they plan to accomplish during class/after class. The one aspect we were not completely ready for, however are more prepared now because we know what to expect, was the sprint review. We all had completed the reading and were making progress on the project, however I definitely breezed through the reading in favor of working on the project when there should have been more balance between the two aspects. Going forward, we plan on organizing better as a team and being more prepared by knowing that the readings are important, as well as the project.

# Exam question

**Q:** Bits are pretty important when it comes to data storage. Let’s say that I want to take a couple pictures during my holiday to the moon, so I take a 16 **KiB** SD card on my trip, and say each picture takes up 5 bits of storage. How many photos can I take?

**A:** Well, 16 KiB is 16000 B, and there are 8 bits in a Byte. So in total we have 128000 bits of storage, and that translates to 25,600 photos on my SD card.
